##### How to contribute?
1. Fork the Ice framework repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **dev** branch*.

*please do not send files from `/ext` directory, just those from the `/ice`.

### Installation
Ice is a C extension, so you need to download a binary for your platform or compile it from source code.

### Download
OpenSUSE package: [php5-ice](http://software.opensuse.org/package/php5-ice)

### Compilation
There are two ways to compile Ice framework*:
* compile from `/ext` folder and C-files - recommended for beginners and for production machines; C-files are generated by Ice Team from time to time (eg. for every release)
* build by [zephir](https://github.com/ice/zephir) (generate, compile and install extension) - recommended for developers and for testing next release; by this way you generate C-files from Zep-files, so you can get newest features/fixes but it could be unstable

*before compilation please read the [Requirements](#requirements).

***

#### Compile from `/ext`:
Clone and install from GitHub:
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ice/framework.git
cd framework/ext/
sudo ./install
```

###### or install using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```sh
composer create-project iceframework/framework --no-dev
```

##### Add extension to your php.ini:
```ini
extension=ice.so
```

Finally restart the webserver

***

#### Build by zephir* (generate, compile and install extension):
###### By default `./vendor/bin/zephir` runns zephir. You must run zephir begin in the `/framework` directory to build Ice:
```sh
cd framework/
./vendor/bin/zephir build
```

*if you don't have zephir you need to compile zephir.

##### Compile zephir
###### You can install zephir using composer. If you already have ice and you are inside `/framework` directory:
```sh
composer update
```

###### or clone zephir repo:
```sh
mkdir vendor/phalcon/ && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/phalcon/zephir.git

# Compile json-c:
cd zephir/
./install-json

# Install zephir
./install

# Create symbolic link
mkdir ../../bin && cd $_
ln -s ../phalcon/zephir/bin/zephir
```

###### Run zephir first time:
```sh
cd framework/
./vendor/bin/zephir
```

***

#### Requirements
You can build from C-files or build by zephir

##### To build the PHP extension:
* g++ >= 4.4/clang++ >= 3.x/vc++ 9
* gnu make 3.81 or later
* php development headers and tools

##### To compile zephir-parser
* json-c (from Github)
* re2c

Ubuntu:
```sh
sudo apt-get install php5-dev libpcre3-dev gcc make re2c
```

Suse:
```sh
sudo zypper install php5-devel pcre-devel gcc make re2c
```

CentOS/Fedora/RHEL
```sh
sudo yum install php-devel pcre-devel gcc make re2c
```
